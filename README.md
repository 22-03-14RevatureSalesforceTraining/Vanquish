# Dalton's Project 2 branch

## Project Description

The associate squad should create a custom Salesforce application based on a 
business of their choosing.

## Technologies Used

* Salesforce

## Core Declarative Requirements:
DATA MODEL:
* The data model should offer a reasonable interpretation of the selected 
business. 
* Relationships, including Lookup & Master-Detail, should be carefully considered 
and implemented.

SECURITY:
* Org level security should be configured for at least two distinct profiles.
* Object level security should be configured for at least three distinct user types.
* Record level security & access should be configured for the organization, 
including Org-Wide Defaults, a customized Role Hierarchy, Sharing Rules, and the 
ability for Manual Sharing.
* Field level security should be configured.

DECLARATIVE UI (USER INTERFACE) CUSTOMIZATION:
* There should be at least one custom app which includes a custom home page.
* Custom and standard objects should have configured page layouts.

PROCESS AUTOMATION:
* There should be a minimum of one of each of the following:
  * Screen Flow
  * Before-save Flow
  * After-save Flow
  * Autolaunched Flow
* Flows should feature interaction with the database and should demonstrate an 
understanding of working with single and bulk records.

REPORTS & DASHBOARDS
* Use of both a Standard Report Type & Custom Report Type.

APEX TESTING
* The team should ensure that their Apex code has adequate test coverage –
both individually and collectively – and that their tests follow testing best 
practices.

APEX TRIGGERS
* At minimum, each squad member should create an Apex trigger and 
associated handler that follows best practices and is relevant to the business use 
case.

PLATFORM EVENTS
* Collectively, the team should implement each of the following:
  * A Platform Event.
  * Apex code or a flow that fires an instance of the above Platform Event.
  * An Apex Trigger or Platform-Event Triggered Flow that is invoked by the 
reception of the above Platform Event.

VISUALFORCE
* At minimum, each squad member should create the following:
  * A Visualforce page relevant to the business use case.
  * Associated custom Apex code (either through a Custom Controller or 
Controller Extension)

## Peripheral Requirements:

SALES CLOUD:
* Leads & Opportunities should be customized as needed to reflect the business 
being modeled.
  * Leads should have multiple rule entries for both Assignment Rules & AutoResponse Rules. 
  * Web-to-lead should be set up to allow a customer to submit a lead.
  * An Opportunity path should provide step by step guidance and a 
celebratory effect upon completion.

SERVICE CLOUD:
* Ensure cases are configured to accurately represent business needs.
  * Cases should have multiple rule entries for both Assignment Rules and 
Auto-Response Rules.
  * Web-to-Case should be set up to allow a customer to submit a case.
  * Case paths should offer step by step guidance on cases.

PROCESS AUTOMATION (PERIPHERAL)
* The following process automation tools should be implemented:
  * Workflow Rule
  * Process configured through Process Builder
  * Multi-step Approval Process
  * Schedule-Triggered Flow
  * Platform Event-Triggered Flow
  
EXPERIENCE CLOUD
* The squad should create a customer-facing Experience Cloud site.
INTEGRATION
* The team should make use of an External API by writing Apex code that 
consumes the selected webservice.
* The chosen API should be relevant to the business use case.
* The response from the API should be parsed and displayed to the user.
